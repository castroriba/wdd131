      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="images/Image1.jpeg" width="500" height="auto" alt="My profile picture">

      <p>My Name is Castro Oriba, though I love to be called Castro. I was born and raised in Uganda, a country found in the eastern side of Africa. I currently work for GMS as a mentor serving BYU-Pathway students. I am not married but am looking towards getting married one day and having beautiful, wonderful children. I love to swim, adventure, travel and I have great taste and love for Indian movies.</p>
      <h2>Uganda</h2>

      <p>Uganda, a country located in East Africa, is a treasure trove of natural beauty, rich culture, and resilient people. From the majestic Murchison Falls to the lush green hills of Kigezi, Uganda's diverse landscapes are a sight to behold. The country is also home to a vibrant cultural heritage, with over 50 languages spoken and a variety of traditional music and dance. Despite facing numerous challenges, Ugandans are known for their warmth, hospitality, and determination. Whether you're interested in exploring the great outdoors, immersing yourself in local culture, or simply experiencing the beauty of Africa, Uganda is a destination that has something for everyone.</p>
